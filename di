Dependencies:

Add the following dependencies:
Spring Web (to create RESTful web services)
Spring Boot DevTools (for development and testing convenience)
Spring Boot Starter Thymeleaf (for a web UI, if needed)

Create a Service Class: Create a class annotated with @Service in the com.example.springdependencyinjectionwebapp.service package.

package com.example.springdependencyinjectionwebapp.service;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class GreetingService {
    public String getGreeting() {
        return "Hello, Dependency Injection!";
    }
}
Create a Controller Class: Create a class annotated with @RestController to handle HTTP requests.


package com.example.springdependencyinjectionwebapp.controller;

import com.example.springdependencyinjectionwebapp.service.GreetingService;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class GreetingController {
    private final GreetingService greetingService;

    public GreetingController(GreetingService greetingService) {
        this.greetingService = greetingService;
    }

    @GetMapping("/greet")
    public String greet() {
        return greetingService.getGreeting();
    }
}
In this example, Spring automatically injects the GreetingService instance into the GreetingController class.

4. Run the Application
In Eclipse, right-click on your main class (annotated with @SpringBootApplication).
Select Run As > Spring Boot App.
The application should start on the default port (usually http://localhost:8080). You can test it by visiting:


http://localhost:8080/greet
You should see the output:

Copy code
Hello, Dependency Injection!
5. Verify Dependency Injection
Spring handles the creation of GreetingService and its injection into GreetingController. You didn't need to manually create or manage dependenciesâ€”this is handled by the Spring framework through its IoC (Inversion of Control) container.

This setup demonstrates how to use dependency injection with a simple Spring web application generated using Spring Initializr and developed using Eclipse
